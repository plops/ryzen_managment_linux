is there a modern c++20 way or a gcc builtin to get the tsc counter?

### Accessing the TSC Counter in Modern C++

Yes, there is a modern and compiler-specific way to get the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) value, particularly with GCC and Clang. While the C++20 standard itself does not provide a direct, portable way to access the TSC, compilers that target x86 architectures offer built-in functions (intrinsics) for this purpose.

#### Using GCC/Clang Built-ins

For GCC and Clang, the recommended way to read the TSC is through the `__builtin_rdtsc` intrinsic. This is a special function known to the compiler that will be replaced by the `rdtsc` assembly instruction.

Here is how you can use it:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <x86intrin.h> // For __rdtsc()

int main() {
    unsigned long long tsc_value = __rdtsc();
    std::cout << "TSC value: " << tsc_value << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

To compile this, you'll need to be on an x86-64 architecture. This approach is generally preferred over inline assembly because the compiler has a better understanding of the intrinsic and can perform more effective optimizations around it.

#### The `rdtscp` Instruction and Serialization

A related instruction is `rdtscp`. It is similar to `rdtsc` but with an important difference: it is partially serializing. This means that when you call `rdtscp`, it will wait for all previous instructions to complete before reading the TSC. This can be useful for benchmarking to prevent the processor's out-of-order execution from affecting your measurements.

GCC and Clang also provide an intrinsic for `rdtscp`: `__builtin_ia32_rdtscp`.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <x86intrin.h> // For __rdtscp()

int main() {
    unsigned int aux;
    unsigned long long tsc_value = __rdtscp(&aux);
    std::cout << "TSC value: " << tsc_value << std::endl;
    // aux will contain the value of the IA32_TSC_AUX MSR
    return 0;
}
```

#### Caveats and Considerations

*   **TSC Stability**: As you've noted, the TSC is not always a reliable timer, especially on systems with aggressive power management that changes the CPU frequency. Modern processors often have a "constant TSC" or "invariant TSC" which runs at a fixed rate regardless of the core's frequency, making it more suitable for wall-clock timing. You can check for the `constant_tsc` flag in `/proc/cpuinfo` on Linux.
*   **Synchronization Across Cores**: On multi-core systems, there is no guarantee that the TSCs on different cores are synchronized. If you need to correlate timestamps between threads running on different cores, you should either lock the threads to specific cores or be aware of this potential for drift.
*   **Converting to Wall-Clock Time**: The TSC counts cycles, not nanoseconds. To convert a TSC value to a unit of time, you need to know the TSC frequency. This can be complex to determine accurately from user space, as it may require privileged instructions. Often, the best approach is to calibrate the TSC against a known clock source like `std::chrono::steady_clock`.

#### Is there a C++20 `std::chrono` way?

There is no direct C++20 `std::chrono` clock that exposes the TSC. The standard clocks like `std::chrono::steady_clock` are designed to be portable abstractions. On Linux, the implementation of `steady_clock` might use the TSC under the hood (via the vDSO mechanism) if the kernel has determined it to be stable, but this is an implementation detail you cannot directly control.

You could, in theory, create a custom C++20 clock that uses `__builtin_rdtsc` in its `now()` function. This would allow you to integrate TSC-based timing more cleanly into `std::chrono`-based code. However, you would be responsible for handling the conversion from TSC ticks to a standard time unit and for addressing the stability and synchronization issues mentioned above.

In summary, for direct access to the TSC for high-resolution timing, using the `__builtin_rdtsc` and `__rdtscp` intrinsics provided by GCC is the recommended modern approach. While not part of the C++ standard, it is a well-supported and efficient way to leverage this hardware feature.
