Model response


Of course. Here are implementations of various micro-benchmarks designed to exercise specific functional units of modern AMD Ryzen and Threadripper processors. These workloads are written in C++ and leverage GCC/Clang built-ins where appropriate.

Each workload is encapsulated in a function that takes a `uint64_t iterations` parameter to control the amount of work performed. This allows you to run them for a specific duration in your testing framework.

### 1. Integer ALU Workload (Arithmetic Logic Unit)
This workload performs a series of simple, independent integer operations. The goal is to keep the integer execution units of the CPU core saturated. By using several independent variables, we can help the CPU's out-of-order execution engine to issue multiple instructions per clock cycle.

**Target:** Integer ALUs, Out-of-Order Execution Engine.
**Characteristics:** High Instructions Per Cycle (IPC), low cache pressure.

```cpp
#include <cstdint>

// This workload is designed to saturate the integer execution units.
// We use multiple independent accumulators to expose instruction-level
// parallelism to the CPU's superscalar, out-of-order execution engine.
// The operations are simple additions, which are among the fastest instructions.
void alu_workload(uint64_t iterations) {
    volatile uint64_t a = 0, b = 1, c = 2, d = 3;
    for (uint64_t i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
        a += i;
        b += a;
        c -= b;
        d *= c; // Multiplication is more complex but still targets integer units
    }
}
```

### 2. AVX2 & FPU Workload (Floating Point / SIMD)
This workload uses Advanced Vector Extensions 2 (AVX2) to perform parallel operations on 256-bit registers, each holding eight single-precision floating-point numbers. This heavily stresses the floating-point and SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) execution units.

**Target:** Floating Point Units (FPUs), AVX2 execution units.
**Characteristics:** High floating-point operations per second (FLOPS), generates significant heat.

```cpp
#include <immintrin.h> // Header for AVX intrinsics

// This workload stresses the AVX2 SIMD units by performing parallel
// floating-point operations. Each AVX2 register (__m256) holds 8
// single-precision floats. We perform fused multiply-add operations,
// which are common in scientific computing and machine learning.
void avx2_fpu_workload(uint64_t iterations) {
    // Initialize three 256-bit AVX registers with 8 floats each
    __m256 ymm0 = _mm256_set_ps(1.1f, 2.2f, 3.3f, 4.4f, 5.5f, 6.6f, 7.7f, 8.8f);
    __m256 ymm1 = _mm256_set_ps(0.1f, 0.2f, 0.3f, 0.4f, 0.5f, 0.6f, 0.7f, 0.8f);
    __m256 ymm2 = _mm256_set_ps(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);

    for (uint64_t i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
        // Perform a fused multiply-add: ymm0 = (ymm1 * ymm0) + ymm2
        // This is a single instruction that does 16 floating point operations (8 muls, 8 adds)
        ymm0 = _mm256_fmadd_ps(ymm1, ymm0, ymm2);
    }
    // Store the result to a volatile variable to prevent the loop from being optimized away
    volatile float result[8];
    _mm256_storeu_ps(result, ymm0);
}
```

### 3. Branch Predictor Stress Test
This workload executes a branch (`if` statement) whose direction depends on pseudo-random data. This makes it very difficult for the CPU's branch predictor to guess the outcome, leading to frequent pipeline flushes and re-fetches, which significantly lowers performance.

**Target:** Branch Prediction Unit (BPU).
**Characteristics:** Low IPC, high number of pipeline stalls.

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <algorithm>
#include <random>

// This workload is designed to cause maximum branch mispredictions.
// We create a vector of random data and then iterate through it,
// performing a data-dependent branch. The randomness makes it nearly
// impossible for the hardware branch predictor to guess correctly.
void branch_predictor_workload(uint64_t iterations) {
    // Generate a large amount of unpredictable data
    constexpr size_t data_size = 16384;
    std::vector<uint32_t> data(data_size);
    std::mt19937 rng(1337); // Seeded for reproducibility
    std::uniform_int_distribution<uint32_t> dist;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < data_size; ++i) {
        data[i] = dist(rng);
    }

    volatile uint64_t counter = 0;
    for (uint64_t i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
        // The condition `data[i % data_size] > (UINT32_MAX / 2)` will be true ~50% of the time,
        // but in a random pattern. This is the worst-case scenario for a branch predictor.
        if (data[i % data_size] > (UINT32_MAX / 2)) {
            counter++;
        } else {
            counter--;
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. L1 Cache Bandwidth
This workload repeatedly accesses a small array that fits comfortably inside the L1 data cache (typically 32KB on modern Ryzen CPUs). By accessing data sequentially, we also trigger the hardware prefetcher, leading to very high memory bandwidth from the L1 cache.

**Target:** L1 Data Cache, Hardware Prefetcher.
**Characteristics:** Extremely high memory throughput, low latency access.

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <vector>

// This workload targets the L1 data cache. We allocate an array that is
// small enough to fit entirely within the L1D cache (e.g., 16KB < 32KB).
// We then repeatedly iterate over it to measure the bandwidth of the fastest
// cache level.
void l1_cache_workload(uint64_t iterations) {
    constexpr int l1_size_kb = 16;
    constexpr int num_elements = (l1_size_kb * 1024) / sizeof(uint64_t);
    std::vector<uint64_t> l1_data(num_elements, 1);

    for (uint64_t i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
        for (int j = 0; j < num_elements; ++j) {
            // Read and write to the same location to ensure the cache line is modified
            l1_data[j] *= 3;
            l1_data[j] /= 3;
        }
    }
}
```

### 5. Main Memory Bandwidth (DRAM)
This workload allocates a very large array that cannot fit in any of the CPU caches, forcing all reads and writes to go to the main system memory (DRAM). This measures the bandwidth of the memory controller and the DRAM modules.

**Target:** Memory Controller, DDR4/DDR5 DRAM.
**Characteristics:** CPU is often waiting for data (memory-bound), lower IPC.

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <vector>

// This workload is designed to bypass all CPU caches and measure main memory
// (DRAM) bandwidth. We allocate a very large buffer (e.g., 512MB) that
// cannot fit in the L3 cache.
void memory_bandwidth_workload(uint64_t iterations) {
    constexpr size_t buffer_size_mb = 512;
    constexpr size_t num_elements = (buffer_size_mb * 1024 * 1024) / sizeof(uint64_t);
    std::vector<uint64_t> memory_buffer(num_elements);

    // Using non-temporal stores (_mm_stream_si64) can be even more effective
    // as they bypass the cache hierarchy, writing directly to memory.
    // For simplicity, a standard loop is shown here.
    for (uint64_t i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
        for (size_t j = 0; j < num_elements; ++j) {
            // A simple write operation is enough to saturate memory bandwidth.
            memory_buffer[j] = i + j;
        }
    }
}
```

### 6. Cache and Memory Latency (Pointer Chasing)
This workload measures latency rather than bandwidth. It creates a linked list within a large array and traverses it. Because each access depends on the result of the previous one, the CPU cannot use its out-of-order capabilities or prefetchers, exposing the true latency of accessing different levels of the memory hierarchy.

**Target:** L1/L2/L3 Cache and DRAM Latency.
**Characteristics:** Very low IPC, performance is dictated by memory access time.

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <vector>
#include <numeric>
#include <random>
#include <algorithm>

// This workload measures memory latency by "pointer chasing". We create a
// shuffled sequence of indices that form a giant cycle. Each memory access
// depends on the value loaded from the previous one, defeating hardware
// prefetchers and exposing the true latency of the memory subsystem.
// Varying the vector size can target L1, L2, L3, or main memory.
void memory_latency_workload(uint64_t iterations) {
    constexpr size_t num_elements = 256 * 1024; // ~2MB to target L3 cache
    std::vector<size_t> p(num_elements);
    std::iota(p.begin(), p.end(), 0); // Fill with 0, 1, 2, ...
    std::mt19937 rng(1337);
    std::shuffle(p.begin(), p.end(), rng); // Shuffle to create random access pattern

    volatile size_t k = 0;
    for (uint64_t i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
        k = p[k]; // Chase the pointer
    }
}
```

### 7. Atomic Operations and Inter-Core Contention
This workload is meant for a multi-threaded context. Multiple threads hammer on the same atomic variable. This creates heavy traffic on the cache coherency protocol (like MOESI on AMD CPUs) and the Infinity Fabric that connects the cores.

**Target:** Cache Coherency Protocol, Inter-core Interconnect (Infinity Fabric).
**Characteristics:** Performance scales poorly with more threads due to contention.

```cpp
#include <cstdint>
#include <atomic>
#include <thread>
#include <vector>

// This workload is meant to be run by multiple threads simultaneously
// to stress the cache coherency protocol. All threads attempt to
// modify the same atomic variable, creating high contention.
void atomic_contention_workload(uint64_t iterations, std::atomic<uint64_t>& shared_counter) {
    for (uint64_t i = 0; i < iterations; ++i) {
        // fetch_add is a read-modify-write operation that must be
        // synchronized across all cores, creating a bottleneck.
        shared_counter.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_relaxed);
    }
}

// Example usage:
// std::atomic<uint64_t> counter = 0;
// uint64_t iter_per_thread = 1000000;
// std::vector<std::thread> threads;
// int num_threads = std::thread::hardware_concurrency();
// for(int i=0; i < num_threads; ++i) {
//     threads.emplace_back(atomic_contention_workload, iter_per_thread, std::ref(counter));
// }
// for(auto& t : threads) {
//     t.join();
// }
```
